## Intro

Everybody knows about **Nobel prize**. But have you ever wondered:

- *How old* were the first Nobel candidates when they got the awards?
- Who is *the youngest* Nobel laureate?
- *How long* do Nobel laureates live?
- *How long* do Nobel laureates live after they get the award?

If you would like to answer these or similar questions, <br> look at the next couple of slides :)
